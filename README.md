Welcome to our first course on introducting the basic concepts underlying machine learning and how they can be applied. The course is split in 4 sessions:
1. What is Machine Learning?
2. Supervised Learning
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Dimensionality Reduction

Every session is based on a jupyter notebook that you can execute via https://colab.research.google.com.
